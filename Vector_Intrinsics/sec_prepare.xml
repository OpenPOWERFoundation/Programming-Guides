  <para>To port Intel intrinsics to POWER you will need to prepare yourself

        that the intrinsic header implementation depends 
        on.  As many of the GCC intrinsics for x86 are implemented via C vector 
        extensions, reading and understanding of this code is an important part of the 
        porting process. </para>

      <para>Intel (x86) intrinsic and type naming conventions and how to find 
      more information. The intrinsic name encodes  some information about the 
      vector size and type of the data, but the pattern is not always  obvious. 
      Using the online 
      <link xlink:href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#">Intel 
      Intrinsic Guide</link> to look up the intrinsic by name is a good first 
      step.</para>

      <para>PowerISA Vector facilities. The Vector facilities of POWER8 are 
      extensive and cover the usual types and usual operations. However it has a 
      different history and organization from Intel.  Both (Intel and PowerISA) have 
      their quirks and in some cases the mapping may not be obvious. So familiarizing 
      yourself with the PowerISA Vector (VMX) and Vector Scalar Extensions (VSX) is 
      important.</para>
