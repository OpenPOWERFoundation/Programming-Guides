  <title>How did I find this out?</title>
  
  <para>The next question is where did I get the details above. The GCC 
  documentation for <emphasis role="bold"><literal>__builtin_ia32_loadupd</literal></emphasis>
  provides minimal information (the 
  builtin name, parameters and return types). Not very informative. </para>

  <para>Looking up the Intel intrinsic description is more informative. You 
  can Google the intrinsic name or use the 
  <link xlink:href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel 
  Intrinsic guide</link> for this. The Intrinsic Guide is interactive and 
  includes  Intel (Chip) technology and text based search capabilities. Clicking 
  on the intrinsic name opens to a synopsis including; the underlying instruction 
  name, text description, operation pseudo code, and in some cases performance 
  information (latency and throughput).</para>

  <para>The key is to get a description of the intrinsic (operand fields and 
  types, and which fields are updated for the result) and the underlying Intel 
  instruction. If the Intrinsic guide is not clear you can look up the 
  instruction details in the 
  “<link xlink:href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm">Intel® 64 and IA-32 
  Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</link>”.</para>

  <para>Information about the PowerISA vector facilities is found in the 
  <link xlink:href="https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=ibm-power-isa-version-2-07-b">PowerISA Version 2.07B</link> (for POWER8 and 
  <link xlink:href="https://www.docdroid.net/tWT7hjD/powerisa-v30.pdf.html">3.0 for 
  POWER9</link>) manual, Book I, Chapter 6. Vector Facility and Chapter 7. 
  Vector-Scalar Floating-Point Operations. Another good reference is the 
  <link xlink:href="https://openpowerfoundation.org/technical/technical-resources/technical-specifications/">OpenPOWER ELF V2 application binary interface</link> (ABI) 
  document, Chapter 6. Vector Programming Interfaces and Appendix A. Predefined 
  Functions for Vector Programming.</para>

  <para>Another useful document is the original <link xlink:href="http://www.nxp.com/assets/documents/data/en/reference-manuals/ALTIVECPEM.pdf">Altivec Technology Programers Interface Manual</link> 
  with a  user friendly structure and many helpful diagrams. But alas the PIM does does not 
  cover the resent PowerISA (power7,  power8, and power9) enhancements.</para>
