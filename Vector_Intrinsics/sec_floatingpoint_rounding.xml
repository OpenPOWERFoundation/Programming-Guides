  <title>Floating-point rounding modes</title>
  
  <para>The Intel (x86 / x86_64) and PowerISA architectures both support the 
  4 IEEE754 rounding modes. Again while the Intel Intrinsic API allows the 
  application to change rounding modes via updates to the 
  <literal>MXCSR</literal> it is a bad idea 
  and should be replaced with the POSIX APIs (<literal>fegetround</literal> and 
  <literal>fesetround</literal>). </para>
