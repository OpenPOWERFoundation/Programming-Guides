  <title>Profound differences</title>
  
  <para>We have already mentioned above a number of architectural differences 
  that effect porting of codes containing Intel intrinsics to POWER. The fact 
  that Intel supports multiple vector extensions with different vector widths 
  (64, 128, 256, and 512-bits) while the PowerISA only supports vectors of 
  128-bits is one issue. Another is the difference in how the respective ISAs 
  support scalars in vector registers is another. Â In the text above we propose 
  workable alternatives for the PowerPC port. There also differences in the 
  handling of floating point exceptions and rounding modes that may impact the 
  application's performance or behavior.</para>
