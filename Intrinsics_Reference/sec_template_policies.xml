    <title xml:id="section_template_policies_title">Policies and conventions</title>
    <para>Most document style policies are established simply by using the template documentation framework.  However, 
    by applying some conventions to the document source structure, community members will be able to work across more d
    ocumentation projects.</para>
    <para>The recommended documentation structure guidelines are as follows:
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The head book file should be named with the prefix "bk_".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The document versioning as defined by the <literal>releaseinfo</literal> tag in the main book
                file <literal>bk_xxx</literal> should be named "Revision N.N", not "Version N.N" or simply "N.N"</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Chapters files should be named with the prefix "ch_".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Section and sub-section files should be named with the prefix "sec_".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Appendix files should be named with the prefix "app_".</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Figures source and images should be placed in the <literal>figures</literal> sub-directory for the document.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>In addition to documentation structure, general community/project guidelines are as follows:
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Contributions to the documentation projects should conform to the <citetitle>Developer Certificate
                Of Origin</citetitle> as defined at <link xlink:href="http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin">
                http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin</link>. Commits to the GitHub project need
                to contain the following line to indicate the submitter accepts the
