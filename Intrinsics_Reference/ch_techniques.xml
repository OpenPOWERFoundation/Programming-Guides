  <title>Vector Programming Techniques</title>

  <section>
    <title>Help the Compiler Help You</title>
    <para>
      Start with scalar code, which is the most portable.  Use various
      tricks for helping the compiler vectorize scalar code.  Make
      sure you align your data on 16-byte boundaries wherever
      possible, and tell the compiler it's aligned.  Use __restrict__
      pointers to promise data does not alias.

  <section>
    <title>Use Portable Intrinsics</title>
    <para>
      Individual compilers may provide other intrinsic support.  Only
      the intrinsics in this manual are guaranteed to be portable
      across compliant compilers.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some compilers may provide compatibility headers for use with
      other architectures.  Recent GCC and Clang compilers support
      compatibility headers for the lower levels of the x86 vector
      architecture.  These can be used initially for ease of porting,
      but for best performance, it is preferable to rewrite important
      sections of code with native Power intrinsics.
