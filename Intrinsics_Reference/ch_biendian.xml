  <title>The POWER Bi-Endian Vector Programming Model</title>

  <para>
    To ensure portability of applications optimized to exploit the
    SIMD functions of POWER ISA processors, this reference defines a
    set of functions and data types for SIMD programming.  Compliant
    compilers will provide suitable support for these functions,
    preferably as built-in functions that translate to one or more
    POWER ISA instructions.
  </para>
  <para>
    Compilers are encouraged, but not required, to provide built-in
    functions to access individual instructions in the IBM POWER®
    instruction set architecture. In most cases, each such built-in
    function should provide direct access to the underlying
    instruction.
  </para>
  <para>
    However, to ease porting between little-endian (LE) and big-endian
    (BE) POWER systems, and between POWER and other platforms, it is
    preferable that some built-in functions provide the same semantics
    on both LE and BE POWER systems, even if this means that the
    built-in functions are implemented with different instruction
    sequences for LE and BE. To achieve this, vector built-in
    functions provide a set of functions derived from the set of
    hardware functions provided by the POWER SIMD instructions. Unlike
    traditional “hardware intrinsic” built-in functions, no fixed
    mapping exists between these built-in functions and the generated
    hardware instruction sequence. Rather, the compiler is free to
    generate optimized instruction sequences that implement the
    semantics of the program specified by the programmer using these
    built-in functions. 
  </para>
  <para>
    As we've seen, the POWER SIMD instructions operate on groups of 1,
    2, 4, 8, or 16 vector elements at a time in 128-bit registers. On
    a big-endian POWER platform, vector elements are loaded from
    memory into a register so that the 0th element occupies the
    high-order bits of the register, and the (N &#8211; 1)th element
    occupies the low-order bits of the register. This is referred to
    as big-endian element order. On a little-endian POWER platform,
    vector elements are loaded from memory such that the 0th element
    occupies the low-order bits of the register, and the (N &#8211;
    1)th element occupies the high-order bits. This is referred to as
    little-endian element order.
  </para>

      Chapter 6 of the 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification for POWER.

    <title>Language Elements</title>
    <para>
      The C and C++ languages are extended to use new identifiers
      <code>vector</code>, <code>pixel</code>, <code>bool</code>,
      <code>__vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>, and
      <code>__bool</code>.  These keywords are used to specify vector
      data types (<xref linkend="VIPR.ch-data-types" />).  Because
      these identifiers may conflict with keywords in more recent C
      and C++ language standards, compilers may implement these in one
      of two ways.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <code>__vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>,
	  <code>__bool</code>, and <code>bool</code> are defined as
	  keywords, with <code>vector</code> and <code>pixel</code> as
	  predefined macros that expand to <code>__vector</code> and
	  <code>__pixel</code>, respectively.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <code>__vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>, and
	  <code>__bool</code> are defined as keywords in all contexts,
	  while <code>vector</code>, <code>pixel</code>, and
	  <code>bool</code> are treated as keywords only within the
	  context of a type declaration.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Vector literals may be specified using a type cast and a set of
      literal initializers in parentheses or braces.  For example,
    </para>
    <programlisting>vector int x = (vector int) (4, -1, 3, 6);
vector double g = (vector double) { 3.5, -24.6 };</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="VIPR.ch-data-types">
    <title>Vector Data Types</title>
    <para>
      Languages provide support for the data types in <xref
      linkend="VIPR.biendian.vectypes" /> to represent vector data
      types stored in vector registers.
    </para> 
    <para>
      For the C and C++ programming languages (and related/derived
      languages), these data types may be accessed based on the type
      names listed in <xref linkend="VIPR.biendian.vectypes" /> when
      POWER SIMD language extensions are enabled using either the
      <code>vector</code> or <code>__vector</code> keywords.
    </para> 
    <para>
      For the Fortran language, <xref
      linkend="VIPR.biendian.fortran-types" /> gives a correspondence
      between Fortran and C/C++ language types.
    </para>
    <para>
      The assignment operator always performs a byte-by-byte data copy
      for vector data types.
    </para>
    <para>
      Like other C/C++ language types, vector types may be defined to
      have const or volatile properties. Vector data types can be
      defined as being in static, auto, and register storage.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pointers to vector types are defined like pointers of other
      C/C++ types. Pointers to vector objects may be defined to have
      const and volatile properties.  Pointers to vector objects must
      be divisible by 16, as vector objects are always aligned on
      quadword (128-bit) boundaries.
    </para>
    <para>
      The preferred way to access vectors at an application-defined
      address is by using vector pointers and the C/C++ dereference
      operator <code>*</code>. Similar to other C/C++ data types, the
      array reference operator <code>[]</code> may be used to access
      vector objects with a vector pointer with the usual definition
      to access the <emphasis>n</emphasis>th vector element from a
      vector pointer. The dereference operator <code>*</code> may
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used to access data that is not
      aligned at least to a quadword boundary.  Built-in functions
      such as <code>vec_xl</code> and <code>vec_xst</code> are
      provided for unaligned data access.
    </para>
    <para>
      One vector type may be cast to another vector type without
      restriction.  Such a cast is simply a reinterpretation of the
      bits, and does not change the data.
    </para>
    <para>
      Compilers are expected to recognize and optimize multiple
      operations that can be optimized into a single hardware
      instruction. For example, a load and splat hardware instruction
      might be generated for the following sequence:
    </para>
    <programlisting>double *double_ptr;
register vector double vd = vec_splats(*double_ptr);</programlisting>

    <title>Vector Operators</title>
    <para>
      In addition to the dereference and assignment operators, the
      POWER Bi-Endian Vector Programming Model provides the usual
      operators that are valid on pointers; these operators are also
      valid for pointers to vector types.
    </para>
    <para>
      The traditional C/C++ operators are defined on vector types
      with “do all” semantics for unary and binary <code>+</code>,
      unary and binary &#8211;, binary <code>*</code>, binary
      <code>%</code>, and binary <code>/</code> as well as the unary
      and binary shift, logical and comparison operators, and the
      ternary <code>?:</code> operator.
    </para>
    <para>
      For unary operators, the specified operation is performed on
      the corresponding base element of the single operand to derive
      the result value for each vector element of the vector
      result. The result type of unary operations is the type of the
      single input operand.
    </para>
    <para>
      For binary operators, the specified operation is performed on
      the corresponding base elements of both operands to derive the
      result value for each vector element of the vector
      result. Both operands of the binary operators must have the
      same vector type with the same base element type. The result
      of binary operators is the same type as the type of the input
      operands.
    </para> 
    <para>
      Further, the array reference operator may be applied to vector
      data types, yielding an l-value corresponding to the specified
      element in accordance with the vector element numbering rules (see 
      <xref linkend="VIPR.biendian.layout" />). An l-value may either
      be assigned a new value or accessed for reading its value.

    <title>Vector Layout and Element Numbering</title>
    <para>
      Vector data types consist of a homogeneous sequence of elements
      of the base data type specified in the vector data
      type. Individual elements of a vector can be addressed by a
      vector element number. Element numbers can be established either
      by counting from the “left” of a register and assigning the
      left-most element the element number 0, or from the “right” of
      the register and assigning the right-most element the element
      number 0.
    </para>
    <para>
      In big-endian environments, establishing element counts from the
      left makes the element stored at the lowest memory address the
      lowest-numbered element. Thus, when vectors and arrays of a
      given base data type are overlaid, vector element 0 corresponds
      to array element 0, vector element 1 corresponds to array
      element 1, and so forth.
    </para>
    <para>
      In little-endian environments, establishing element counts from
      the right makes the element stored at the lowest memory address
      the lowest-numbered element. Thus, when vectors and arrays of a
      given base data type are overlaid, vector element 0 will
      correspond to array element 0, vector element 1 will correspond
      to array element 1, and so forth.
    </para>
    <para>
      Consequently, the vector numbering schemes can be described as
      big-endian and little-endian vector layouts and vector element
      numberings.
    </para>
    <para>
      This element numbering shall also be used by the <code>[]</code>
      accessor method to vector elements provided as an extension of
      the C/C++ languages by some compilers, as well as for other
      language extensions or library constructs that directly or
      indirectly refer to elements by their element number.
    </para>
    <para>
      Application programs may query the vector element ordering in
      use by testing the __VEC_ELEMENT_REG_ORDER__ macro. This macro
      has two possible values:

    <title>Vector Built-In Functions</title>
    <para>
      Some of the POWER SIMD hardware instructions refer, implicitly
      or explicitly, to vector element numbers.  For example, the
      <code>vspltb</code> instruction has as one of its inputs an
      index into a vector.  The element at that index position is to
      be replicated in every element of the output vector.  For
      another example, <code>vmuleuh</code> instruction operates on
      the even-numbered elements of its input vectors.  The hardware
      instructions define these element numbers using big-endian
      element order, even when the machine is running in little-endian
      mode.  Thus, a built-in function that maps directly to the
      underlying hardware instruction, regardless of the target
      endianness, has the potential to confuse programmers on
      little-endian platforms.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is more useful to define built-in functions that map to these
      instructions to use natural element order.  That is, the
      explicit or implicit element numbers specified by such built-in
      functions should be interpreted using big-endian element order
      on a big-endian platform, and using little-endian element order
      on a little-endian platform.
    </para>
    <para>
      The descriptions of the built-in functions in <xref
      linkend="VIPR.vec-ref" /> contain notes on endian issues that
      apply to each built-in function.  Furthermore, a built-in
      function requiring a different compiler implementation for
      big-endian than it uses for little-endian has a sample
      compiler implementation for both BE and LE.  These sample
      implementations are only intended as examples; designers of a
      compiler are free to use other methods to implement the
      specified semantics as they see fit.
    </para>

      <title>Extended Data Movement Functions</title>
      <para>
	The built-in functions in <xref
	linkend="VIPR.biendian.vmx-mem" /> map to Altivec/VMX load and
	store instructions and provide access to the “auto-aligning”
	memory instructions of the VMX ISA where low-order address
	bits are discarded before performing a memory access. These
	instructions access load and store data in accordance with the
	program's current endian mode, and do not need to be adapted
	by the compiler to reflect little-endian operation during code
	generation.

      <para>
	Versions 1.0 through 1.4 of the 64-Bit ELFv2 ABI Specification
	for POWER provided for optional compiler support for using
	big-endian element ordering in little-endian environments.
	This was initially deemed useful for porting certain libraries
	that assumed big-endian element ordering regardless of the
	endianness of their input streams.  In practice, this
	introduced serious compiler complexity without much utility.
	Thus this support (previously controlled by switches
	<code>-maltivec=be</code> and/or <code>-qaltivec=be</code>) is
	now deprecated.  Current versions of the gcc and clang
	open-source compilers do not implement this support.
